I aim to contribute to the development of models that can leverage the use of audio/image crowdsourced data to build diverse models without compromising on the privacy of the users who contribute to this data system. I am currently interning at IIIT Delhi under Dr. Koteswar Rao Jerripothula where I am exploring a special use case of vertical cross-silo federated learning . My last internship's work under The Marconi Society's Celestini Program India was recently by [TensorFlow](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/02/visionair-using-federated-learning-to-estimate-airquality-tensorflow-api-java.html) .I have also contributed to my team's win at several hackathons including the Singapore India Hackathon and The Smart India Hackathon.
