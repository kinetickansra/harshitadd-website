I aim to contribute to the development of models that can leverage the use of audio/image crowdsourced data to build diverse models without compromising on their users privacy. 

I am currently interning at IIIT Delhi under Dr. Koteswar Rao Jerripothula at the NICE Lab where I am exploring a special use case of vertical cross-silo federated learning. 

My last internship's work under The Marconi Society's Celestini Program India was published by [TensorFlow](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/02/visionair-using-federated-learning-to-estimate-airquality-tensorflow-api-java.html) and I have also contributed to my team's win at several hackathons including [The Singapore India Hackathon 2019](https://mic.gov.in/assets/si2019/index.html) and [The Smart India Hackathon 2019](https://www.aicte-india.org/Initiatives/smart-india-hackathon).
