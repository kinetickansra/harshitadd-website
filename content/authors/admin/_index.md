I am currently interning at IIIT Delhi under Dr. Koteswar Rao Jerripothula where I am exploring a special use case of vertical cross-silo federated learning . My last internship's work under The Marconi Society's Celestini Program India was recently published by Tensorflow - Check it out at https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/02/visionair-using-federated-learning-to-estimate-airquality-tensorflow-api-java.html here. have also contributed to my team's win at several hackathons including the Singapore India Hackathon and The Smart India Hackathon.
